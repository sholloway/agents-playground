# PySide6 and WebGPU POC
- - -
This directory contains a proof of concept application of using
the Python WebGPU bindings with PySide6. It is intended to 
develop this POC to flush out the nuances of porting the Agent
Playground to a WebGPU based rendering solution. 

Ultimately this directory will be removed once v0.2.0 of the 
Agent Playground is complete.
