"""
Plan:
1. First Pass
- Move modules that need rewrite (e.g. Scene) into a legacy package.
- Create new packages for the WebGPU modules.
- Stub out new Scene and Landscape classes
- Create a Sim that loads a the scene from a hardcoded python module.
- Get the landscape to render with ambient lightning.
- Make the camera movable with the mouse and keyboard.
2. 2nd Pass
- Attempt to implement the Scene and Landscape with an existing file format (e.g. JSON, TOML)
- If the above fails, then design a file format and write a Parser.

Concepts
- Comment 
- Block Comment 
- Metadata about the landscape.
- Custom attributes. These can be ways to pass data into a sim.
- Landscape Definition
- Tiles

Tile Use Cases
- The origin is fixed.
- Can be on the ground plane of (x, 0, z)
- Can be on a different plane parallel to the XY plane. (x, Y, z)
- A tile can be a wall. That is an edge extruded into a tile.
  A wall is a tile that has been rotated 90 degrees.
- Tiles can be angled to create ramps. A ramp is a tile that has 
  been rotated around an edge.
