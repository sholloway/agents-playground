    Steps:
    1. Build up an internal data structure that represents the triangles.
      What Data Structure?
        - Winged-edge
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_edge
        - Quad-edge
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-edge
        - Half-edge/Doubly linked face list (DLFL)
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list

          A decent fit for path finding across triangles.
          This is promising, however, I need to represent, disconnected graphs.
          Let's try doing this with the half-edge data structure to get started.

      Consider different tesselation approaches.
        - NaÃ¯ve
          Just split a tile into two triangles with no regard to the larger mesh.
        - Treat the landscape as an unstructured grid, and tesselate the grid as a whole.
          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_grid
          - Ruppert's algorithm
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruppert%27s_algorithm

    2. Use this data structure to calculate the vertex normals.
      This is ultimately the problem I'm trying to solve. I need a data structure 
      that enables fast and easy traversal of the mesh to enable calculating the 
      normals of the connected faces per vertex.

      Additionally, the data structure selected for the internal traversal could 
      aid in future efforts to procedurally generate meshes, both landscape and otherwise.
    3. Pack the vertex data and normal data while building an index.
    4. Profit!
